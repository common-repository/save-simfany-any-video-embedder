This plugin allows you to quickly embed videos into your posts, pages or comments using custom player size.

== Description ==

The main advantage of this plug-in is that it supports all embeddable video formats and doesn't need to be updated to support any future ones. It allows you to quickly embed videos into your posts, pages or comments. After the plug-in is installed, you will see either the video button or the Simfany button in your editor. Copy the video embed code or the video link from Youtube or any other video resource and paste it between the [video] tags. It will convert your embed code or the link into very simple Simfany format.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the plug-in archive on your local computer.
2. Upload the "save-simfany-any-video-embedder" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory of your blog.
3. Activate the plug-in through the "Plug-ins" menu in your WordPress.
4. Click on the "Settings" link and set up the plug-in the way you like.
